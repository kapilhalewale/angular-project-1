# Angular QuickStart Source

You can update your existing project to an up-to-date QuickStart by following these instructions:
- Create a new project using the [instructions below](#create-a-new-project-based-on-the-quickstart)
- Copy the code you have in your project's `main.ts` file onto `src/app/main.ts` in the new project
- Copy your old `app` folder into `src/app`
- Delete `src/app/main.ts` if you have one (we now use `src/main.ts` instead)
- Copy your old `index.html`, `styles.css` and `tsconfig.json` into `src/`
- Install all your third party dependencies
- Copy your old `e2e/` folder into `e2e/`
- Copy over any other files you added to your project
- Copy your old `.git` folder into your new project's root

Now you can continue working on the new project.

## Prerequisites

Node.js and npm are essential to Angular development. 
    


## Create a new project based on the QuickStart

Clone this repo into new project folder (e.g., `my-proj`).
```shell
git clone https://github.com/kapilhalewale/angular-project-1.git  my-proj
cd my-proj
```

### Create a new git repo
You could [start writing code](#start-development) now and throw it all away when you're done.
If you'd rather preserve your work under source control, consider taking the following steps.

Initialize this project as a *local git repo* and make the first commit:
```shell
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

Create a *remote repository* for this project on the service of your choice.

Grab its address (e.g. *`https://github.com/<my-org>/my-proj.git`*) and push the *local repo* to the *remote*.
git remote add origin <repo-address>
git push -u origin master
## Install npm packages

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

npm install
npm start

## Cheers you are done
